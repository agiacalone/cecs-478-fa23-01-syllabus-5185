<h3 id="exams">Exams</h3>
<p>Students will take two midterm exams throughout the semester. There will be no makeups allowed for any quiz or exam. A final exam is administered at the conclusion of the semester. There may be some writing on the quizzes and exams.</p>
<h3 id="attendance">Attendance</h3>
<p>Attendance in this course is mandatory, as all material presented during class is fair game for exam questions or homework. Students are responsible for notifying the instructor about any extended leave of absences. There will be no makeups for assignments, quizzes, or exams that are missed due to an unexcused absence.</p>
<h3 id="class-rules">Class Rules</h3>
<p>Homework and lab assignments will be assigned approximately every other week, and will mostly involve written work and coding.</p>
<ul>
<li>Homework and lab assignments are due on the date and time indicated on <a href="http://classroom.github.com">Github Classroom</a></li>
<li>Homework may include writing code, doing research, essay writing, debugging programs, and other disciplines.</li>
<li>Lab assignments will be coding projects designed to practice the concepts discussed in lecture.</li>
<li>You are welcome to work on homework and lab assignments at home, but assistance will only be provided during classtime or office hours.</li>
<li>Labs will be graded on correct answers to required deliverables and/or the completeness of the assignment. Incomplete assignments may receive partial or no credit at the discretion of the instructor.</li>
<li>Students will be expected to read selections from the textbook for every lecture session. These readings should be done before class so that we can have a discussion on the topics during the lecture.</li>
<li>During in-class exams or quizzes, there will be <em>no bathroom breaks</em>. Please be sure to use the restroom prior to the start of the exam. If a student leaves the classroom before the exam has been concluded, that student forfeits the completion of the rest of their exam.</li>
<li>All source code submitted must be adequately commented in order to receive credit. Source code which is not commented with the student’s own comments <em>will not receive any credit</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Late assignments</strong> will, at a minimum, be subject to a 10% reduction in grade <em>per day</em> that the assignment is late. I do not accept homework submissions via email, fax, or any other means than the deliverable requirements listed on the assignment specification.</p>
<h3 id="computer-software">Computer Software</h3>
<p>You will be responsible for finding and installing any software needed to complete the programming assignments for this course. While it is not strictly required, <em>I highly recommend either installing a Linux operating system on your computer or running a virtual machine with Linux as the OS</em>. This course can be completed in its entirety using free, open-source software.</p>
<h3 id="academic-honesty">Academic Honesty</h3>
<p>There is zero tolerance for cheating, plagiarism, or any other act of violation of Academic Integrity Policy. Work that you submit is assumed to be original unless your source material is documented appropriately, using proper citation. Using the ideas or words of another person, even a peer, or a web site, as if it were your own, is plagiarism. Any individual or group caught cheating on homework, lab assignments, or any exam/quiz will be subjected to full extent of academic actions allowed under University regulations. At a minimum, any student caught violating Academic Integrity Policy will receive no credit for the work concerned and one grade lower letter grade. To learn more about the University policy on Cheating and Plagiarism, visit: <a href="https://www.csulb.edu/academic-senate/policy-academic-integrity-regarding-cheating-and-plagiarism">Academic Integrity Regarding Cheating and Plagiarism</a></p>
<h3 id="withdrawal-policy">Withdrawal Policy</h3>
<p>Students may request a withdrawal from the instructor as long as the request meets the requirements of the University and no more than one of the assigned midterm exams has been given to the class. Request for withdrawal from the course involving extenuating circumstances will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of the instructor.</p>
